	doi = {10.1109/IV.2013.8},
	abstract = {We introduce a matrix-based visualization technique for exploring time-varying directed and weighted graphs. Two overview representations are shown: one for the time-aggregated relations with attached quantitative weighted attributes and one for the results of an automatic dynamic pattern identification algorithm, i.e., relations accompanied by categorical attributes. Apart from a dynamic edge pattern categorization, our tool can also compute graph-specific properties—such as shortest paths or the existence of cliques—and highlight their evolution over time. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that allow the user to navigate, explore, and browse the data, based on the Visual Information Seeking Mantra—overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. If an additional hierarchical organization of the vertices is available, this is attached to the matrix by vertical and horizontal layered icicle plots allowing one to explore the data on different levels of hierarchical granularity. The usefulness of the tool is demonstrated by applying it to time-varying migration data in the hierarchically structured world.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel technique for visualizing dense time-varying directed and weighted multi-graphs with an additional hierarchical organization of the graph nodes. Combining Indented Tree Plots and TimeRadarTrees, we show the temporal evolution of relations in a static view. The graph edges are layered around thumbnail wheels consisting of color-coded sectors that are representatives of the graph nodes. These sectors generate implicit representations of graph edges. Start and target vertices are perceived by inspecting the color coding of sectors in the context of other sectors and their orientations. The technique puts emphasis on newer relations and hence, these are mapped to a larger display space in the radial diagram. The benefit of our technique is reduction of visual clutter from which node-link diagrams typically suffer. The visualization focuses on an easy exploration of trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in time-varying relational data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying it to dense dynamic graph data acquired from a soccer match of the 2D Soccer Simulation League.},

	abstract = {We present TimeLineCurator, a browser-based authoring tool that automatically extracts event data from temporal references in unstructured text documents using natural language processing and encodes them along a visual timeline. Our goal is to facilitate the timeline creation process for journalists and others who tell temporal stories online. Current solutions involve manually extracting and formatting event data from source documents, a process that tends to be tedious and error prone. With TimeLineCurator, a prospective timeline author can quickly identify the extent of time encompassed by a document, as well as the distribution of events occurring along this timeline. Authors can speculatively browse possible documents to quickly determine whether they are appropriate sources of timeline material. TimeLineCurator provides controls for curating and editing events on a timeline, the ability to combine timelines from multiple source documents, and export curated timelines for online deployment. We evaluate TimeLineCurator through a benchmark comparison of entity extraction error against a manual timeline curation process, a preliminary evaluation of the user experience of timeline authoring, a brief qualitative analysis of its visual output, and a discussion of prospective use cases suggested by members of the target author communities following its deployment.},
